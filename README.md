Customer Segmentation and Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. 
The analysis uses clustering techniques like K-means and DBSCAN to group customers and analyze the characteristics of each segment. The goal is to understand the different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies to each segment.

Objective
-To segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns.
-To analyze the characteristics of each customer segment to gain actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.


Tools and Libraries:

-Python: Programming language used for analysis and modeling.

-Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

-Numpy: For numerical operations.

-Scikit-learn: For implementing clustering algorithms like K-means.

-Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.


Data Preprocessing:

-Loaded and cleaned the retail dataset.
-Handled missing values, outliers, and data normalization.

Clustering:

-Implemented K-means clustering to segment customers.
-Evaluated the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette score.

Segment Analysis:

-Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment, including average purchase value, frequency, and customer demographics.
-Visualized the segments using scatter plots and cluster centroids.
